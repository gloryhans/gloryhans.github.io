        <h2 id="altered-text">About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Gloria Hansen, and I am attending Utah State University.
            I am a sophomore and plan to graduate in 2026 with a Computer Science degree. I
            plan to explore web development and design as a career.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was born in Salt Lake but grew up in Dallas, Texas. My mom and dad got married
            while in school in Utah. They quickly had my older sister, and my mom dropped out
            to get a full-time job to support my dad as he pursued his goal of becoming a
            lawyer. We moved around for the first four years of my life and then settled in
            Dallas. My mom worked as a web developer remotely for the first six years of my
            life. I vaguely remember watching her and seeing her code.   </p>
        <br>
        <p>As I got older, she bought me kid coding classes where I could create fun little
            apps and games. In middle school, I became obsessed with a website made to teach
            young kids to code called Scratch. I was constantly on it and was creating as much
            as possible.</p>

        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>My high school didn't have coding classes, so I used art as my creative outlet.
            I took all the art classes possible and even took AP art and art history through a
            community college. </p>
        <br>
        <p>As I started looking into schools and paths for my education, I landed on Computer
            Science with the hope of later going to Bridgerland Technical College for graphic
            design. The more CS classes I have taken, the more I have realized that web development
            is what I want to do. Both my passion for art and coding make me a perfect candidate
            for any web development job.</p>
